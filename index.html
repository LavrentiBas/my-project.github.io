        <strong> Metallica</strong> is an American
        <strong>heavy metal </strong>band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los
        Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich and
        has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.</span
      >
      The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made
      them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside
      Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises
      founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime
      lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave
      Mustaine (who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band) and
      bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton, and Jason Newsted are former members
      of the band.

        Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third
        album,</span
      >
      <strong>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f1Ny74_ou0" target="_blank"
          >Master of Puppets (1986)</a
        ></strong
      >
      , cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The
      band's next album,
      <span>
        ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award
        nomination.</span
      >
      Their self titled fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the band's first not
      to root predominantly in thrash metal. It appealed to a more mainstream
      audience, achieving substantial commercial success and
      <span
        >selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date; making it
        the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.</span
      >
      After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent
      releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of
      its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that
      of the band's earlier albums. The band's most recent album is Hardwired...
      to Self-Destruct (2016).
